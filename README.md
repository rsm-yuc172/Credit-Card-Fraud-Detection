In this report, we aimed to capture credit card fraud transactions by implementing data-driven machine learning techniques. The data of 97,852 credit card transaction data encompasses 95,805 non-fraudulent transactions and 2,047 fraudulent transactions. Each of the records documented 10 fields according to the behavior of the transaction. Our goal is to build a machine learning model that can recognize fraud transactions by differentiating the variation in the fields.
To discover the most suitable machine learning model to detect fraud in the data, we will develop a machine learning pipeline with the processes of data exploration, data cleaning, variable creation, feature selection, model selection. Each of the segments will be defined and explained thoroughly in the following sections. The final part of the report, we will discuss what should be the fraud score cutoff to generate the maximum potential benefit for the enterprise.
To briefly summarize the project, by implementing the LightGBM model, the overall average accuracy is 0.74 for training data, 0.74 for testing data, and 0.53 for out-of-time data. From this approach, we selected FDR@4% as our cutoff, which will be capable of capturing 62% of the fraud transaction that accounts for approximately $40.5 million dollars of savings per year.
